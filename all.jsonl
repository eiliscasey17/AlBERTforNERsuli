In the study, we used thorium nitrate (weighed portions with masses of up to 20 g) with decay products accumulated during 60 years.

In the first stage, macroamounts 232Th and accumulated 228Th are separated from a mixture of their decay products (Fig. 1) via extraction of thorium by a 1 : 1 solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) in toluene from 4 M HNO3 solutions. The choce of the extraction agent was governed by earlier studies [4] in which it was found that the best reagent among those examined for separation of 232Th from products formed in its irradiation by high-energy protons (and also of radium and actinium) is HDEHP, which extracts 232Th from nitrate solutions in a wide range of HNO3 concentrations [25–27]. The phases were vigorously agitated for 5 min, centrifuged, and then separated in a separating funnel. The extraction was performed three times, and the aqueous solution with 228Ra was passed, to be fuller purified to remove thorium, through a column with extraction-chromatographic sorbent LN (Triskem Int., France, based on HDEHP, particles size 100–150 mesh).

This  isotope  is  obtained  by  diff erent methods,  including  that  in  which  thorium  targets are  irradiated  with  high-energy  protons.  However, this  method  does  not  fi nd  wide  application  because the  number  of  suitable  accelerators  in  the  world  is exceedingly small, which gives rise to problems with the availability of the given isotope [4]. In addition, 225Ac is not quite convenient for pre-clinical trials because of emitting gamma photons in low yield (not more tham 1% at 100 keV). At the same time, the gamma-emitting isotope 228Ac (T1\/2 = 6.1 h) is present in the radioactive decay series of natural thorium as a product formed in the decay of a mother isotope 228Ra and can be isolated in  the  radiochemically  pure  form.  To  advantages  of 228Ac, isolated from 228Ra belong the long lifetime of the mother nuclide (T1\/2 = 5.7 yrs) and the absence of long-lived daughter nuclide. The activity of 228Ra in the secular equilibrium with 232Th is about 1.6 kBq per gram of thorium nitrate.

{"id":1308,"text":"It was shown by a study of the desorption of 228Ac from  samples  of  commercial  CNMs  in  a  solution  of BSA in BP that up to 30–40% of actinium is desorbed in 30 min, after which the amount of desorption does not change signifi cantly during 150 min (Fig. 4). At the same time, it was found that the desorption of 228Ac from DND-COOH,  GO-H,  and  CNT-H  samples  under  the same conditions does not exceed 5% in 3 h. The change in the behavior of Ac(III) in its sorption from PBS and desorption from BSA in PBS for the commercial DNDs, GO, and CNT and modifi ed DND-COOH, GO-H ,and CNT-H can be accounted for by various factors. The sorption of Ac(III) on a commercial sample of DNDs probably  occurs  by  two  mechanisms:  fi rm  chemical binding  of 228Ac  with  carboxy  groups  and  physical adsorption onto other groups on the DND surface. In the case of DND oxidation to DND-COOH, these groups are  substituted  by  carboxy  groups,  which  negatively aff ects  the  total  amount  of  adsorption  because  of  the disappearance of its physical component, but positively aff ects the strength of binding between the conjugate and actinium in a solution of BSA in PBS. Interpretation of changes of this kind is diffi  cult for GO and GO-H, and a further study of the 228Ac sorption mechanism on these samples  is  necessary. As  for  the  interaction  of 228Ac with CNTs, two mechanisms are probably operative in the sorption: sorption of ions within the tube hollows, as shown previously in [32], and the physical sorption on impurity metals (Table 1) contained at tube ends. In the  hydrogenation,  of  CNTs,  the  catalyst  is  removed, which can account for the decrease in the total amount of  sorption  and  the  increase  in  the  stability  against desorption.","entities":[{"id":10951,"label":"Element","start_offset":45,"end_offset":50},{"id":10952,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":82,"end_offset":86},{"id":10953,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":108,"end_offset":111},{"id":10954,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":115,"end_offset":117},{"id":10955,"label":"Element","start_offset":139,"end_offset":147},{"id":10956,"label":"Element","start_offset":318,"end_offset":323},{"id":10957,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":329,"end_offset":337},{"id":10958,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":340,"end_offset":344},{"id":10959,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":352,"end_offset":357},{"id":10960,"label":"Element","start_offset":452,"end_offset":460},{"id":10961,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":481,"end_offset":484},{"id":10962,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":505,"end_offset":508},{"id":10964,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":535,"end_offset":539},{"id":10965,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":541,"end_offset":543},{"id":10966,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":549,"end_offset":552},{"id":10967,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":567,"end_offset":575},{"id":10968,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":577,"end_offset":581},{"id":10969,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":587,"end_offset":593},{"id":10970,"label":"Element","start_offset":650,"end_offset":657},{"id":10971,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":684,"end_offset":688},{"id":10972,"label":"Element","start_offset":757,"end_offset":762},{"id":10973,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":837,"end_offset":840},{"id":10974,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":865,"end_offset":868},{"id":10975,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":882,"end_offset":890},{"id":10976,"label":"Element","start_offset":1141,"end_offset":1149},{"id":10977,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1170},{"id":10978,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1174,"end_offset":1177},{"id":10979,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1237,"end_offset":1239},{"id":10980,"label":"Element","start_offset":1277,"end_offset":1282},{"id":10981,"label":"Element","start_offset":1365,"end_offset":1370},{"id":10982,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1376,"end_offset":1380},{"id":10983,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1615,"end_offset":1619},{"id":10984,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1244,"end_offset":1248},{"id":15620,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":512,"end_offset":515}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1313,"text":"The mechanism of in situ oxidative radioiodination using chloramine-T (CAT), involving the formation of iodine monochloride (ICl), was elucidated [20, 21]. In weakly  acidic  media,  CAT  dissociates  to ArSO2NCl–anion, which may react directly with iodide to form ICl. Subsequently the iodine monochloride (ICl) reacts with any position in the target molecule that can experience electrophilic substitution [20, 22]. Owing to the diff erence in  the  electronegativity  between  iodine  and  chlorine, ICl is highly polar and acts as a source of iodonium ion (I+). Therefore, aromatic electrophilic labeling with electropositive  radioiodide  usually  proceeds  in  high radiochemical yield compared to 50% yield if molecular iodine is used, because ICl is a stronger iodinating agent than I2 [23, 24].

Radionuclidic, radiochemical, and chemical purity of the eluate proved to be suitable for use in medical applications.","entities":[{"id":11203,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":0,"end_offset":38},{"id":11204,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":76,"end_offset":98},{"id":11205,"label":"Acid","start_offset":100,"end_offset":113},{"id":11206,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":119,"end_offset":135},{"id":11207,"label":"Element","start_offset":187,"end_offset":193},{"id":11208,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":226,"end_offset":265},{"id":11209,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":290,"end_offset":383},{"id":11210,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":478,"end_offset":488},{"id":11212,"label":"Element","start_offset":555,"end_offset":561},{"id":11213,"label":"Yield","start_offset":561,"end_offset":583}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1331,"text":"In  nuclear  medicine,  99mTc  is  the  most  frequently  used  radiotracer  because  of  its  suitable  physical  and  nuclear  properties.  It  emits  monoenergetic  (140  keV)  γ-photon  suitable  for  γ-cameras.  In  addition,  its  half-life of 6 h is suitable for performing the required tests without  exposing  the  patient  to  unacceptable  radiation  dose.  Planar  cameras  are  used  for  bone  scanning  with  99mTc-MDP,  and  SPECT  cameras  are  used  for  cardiac  scanning    with    99mTc-Sestamibi    [1–7].    Cyclotron-produced 99mTc is not practical because of the high cost and short half-life [8–10]. The main source of 99mTc is the β–-decay (87.5%) of 99Mo (T1\/2 = 65.94 h). Techne-tium-99m  of  high  purity,  suitable  for  medical  applica-tions, is obtained by elution of radioisotope generators based on alumina columns loaded with fission 99Mo of high  specific  activity  [11].  Other  sorbents  were  also  tested  for  preparing  99Mo\/99mTc  generators,  such  as  silica  gel,  hydrous  zirconium  oxide,  manganese  diox-ide, and hydrous titanium oxide [12]. The main disad-vantage  of  these  generators  is  the  limited  adsorption  capacity of the base material for 99Mo, which, in turn, requires  the  use  of  99Mo  of  very  high  specific  activity  (of the order of tens thousands Ci g–1), produced from nuclear  reactors  via  fission  route.  Generation  of  high  amounts of intermediate and long-lived fission product waste  as  a  result  of  complex  multistep  separation  and  purification of fission 99Mo in expensive hot cells with sophisticated   equipment   and   infrastructure   are   the main  disadvantages  of  fission  99Mo  radioisotope  gen-erators  [13].  Alternative  technologies  are  required  to  overcome these drawbacks. These alternative technolo-gies  are  based  on  incorporating  neutron  activation  99Mo   of   low   and   medium   specific   activity   (0.3–   3.5  Ci  g–1  Mo)  into  insoluble  precipitates  of  high  Mo  content  such  as  Ce,  Zr,  Mg,  Ti,  Fe,  Th,  Sn,  and  Te  compounds,  which  are  then  used  as  column  matrices  [14–28].  Post-  and  pre-irradiation-formed  gels  are  the  two common techniques used for preparing gel genera-tors. Isotope exchange allows overcoming the radiation degradation  resulting  from  irradiation  of  the  prepared  gel  material  and  the  multistep  procedure  in  pre-  and  post-irradiation-formed   gel   techniques,   respectively   [16, 29]. Solvent extraction of 99mTcO4– or sublimation of 99mTc2O7 has also been used in some generator sys-tems  for  extraction  of  99mTc  from  99Mo  of  relatively  low  specific  activity,  produced  by  direct  neutron  acti-vation of molybdenum targets [12].","entities":[{"id":11214,"label":"Element","start_offset":965,"end_offset":969},{"id":11215,"label":"Element","start_offset":970,"end_offset":975},{"id":11216,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1012},{"id":11217,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1014,"end_offset":1039},{"id":11218,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1042,"end_offset":1061},{"id":11219,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1067,"end_offset":1089},{"id":11220,"label":"Element","start_offset":1207,"end_offset":1211},{"id":11221,"label":"Element","start_offset":1253,"end_offset":1257},{"id":11222,"label":"Element","start_offset":1555,"end_offset":1560},{"id":11223,"label":"Element","start_offset":1683,"end_offset":1687},{"id":11224,"label":"Element","start_offset":1880,"end_offset":1884},{"id":11225,"label":"Element","start_offset":2003,"end_offset":2005},{"id":11226,"label":"Element","start_offset":2026,"end_offset":2028},{"id":11227,"label":"Element","start_offset":2031,"end_offset":2033},{"id":11228,"label":"Element","start_offset":2036,"end_offset":2038},{"id":11229,"label":"Element","start_offset":2041,"end_offset":2043},{"id":11230,"label":"Element","start_offset":2046,"end_offset":2048},{"id":11231,"label":"Element","start_offset":2051,"end_offset":2053},{"id":11232,"label":"Element","start_offset":2056,"end_offset":2058},{"id":11233,"label":"Element","start_offset":2066,"end_offset":2069},{"id":11234,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":2492,"end_offset":2549},{"id":11235,"label":"Element","start_offset":2618,"end_offset":2623},{"id":11236,"label":"Element","start_offset":2631,"end_offset":2635},{"id":11237,"label":"Element","start_offset":24,"end_offset":31},{"id":11238,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":205,"end_offset":214},{"id":11239,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":424,"end_offset":433},{"id":11240,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":441,"end_offset":455},{"id":11241,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":502,"end_offset":517},{"id":11242,"label":"Element","start_offset":550,"end_offset":556},{"id":11243,"label":"Element","start_offset":645,"end_offset":651},{"id":11244,"label":"Element","start_offset":678,"end_offset":683},{"id":11245,"label":"Element","start_offset":701,"end_offset":716},{"id":11246,"label":"Element","start_offset":871,"end_offset":876},{"id":11247,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":835,"end_offset":850},{"id":11248,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":2247,"end_offset":2264},{"id":11249,"label":"Element","start_offset":2725,"end_offset":2736}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1342,"text":"The chemical composition, particularly the Mo con-tent of the zirconium selenomolybdate gel, is a signifi-cant factor for its use as a column matrix in preparation of  gel-type  99Mo\/99mTc  radioisotope  generators.  The  chemical  composition  of  the  obtained  zirconium  se-lenomolybdate  materials  was  studied  radiometrically  by  dissolving  the  gel  materials  prepared  from  the  ra-dioactive solution of 95Zr, 99Mo, and 75Se in a hot con-centrated HCl solution. The table compiles the data on the Mo(VI) precipitation yield, the corresponding equi-librium  pH  value,  and  some  properties  of  the  formed  zirconium selenomolybdate-99Mo products at the given Zr(IV) : Se(IV) : Mo(VI) molar ratios. As can be seen, the  precipitation  yield  of  Mo(VI)  from  the  Mo(VI)–  Se(IV)–Zr(IV) mixed solutions decreased with increas-ing  Se  concentration.  The  Mo  content  decreased  with  increasing Se(IV) content of the gel matrices, ZSM-1 > ZSM-2 > ZSM-3. This means that the selectivity of the positively  charged  zirconia  surface  to  molybdate  and\/or selenite anionic species depends on their concentra-tion  in  the  mixed  solution.  At  low  selenite  concentra-tions,  the  molybdate  anions  show  higher  affinity  for  the  positively  charged  zirconia  surface  than  the  se-lenite  anions  do.  The  SeO32–  anions  appreciably  con-tribute to the ZSM structure at low Mo(VI) content to keep  the  zirconia  surface  neutral.  The  relative  content  of  Zr(IV)  in  the  gel  matrices  decreased  as  the  initial  concentration  of  Se(IV)  in  the  mixed  solutions  in-creased:  ZSM-1>  ZSM-2  >  ZSM-3.  In  addition,  the  weight loss of the precipitates dried at 150 and 200°C to  constant  weight  decreased  with  increasing  Se(IV)  content of the gel matrix. Therefore, ZSM-1 sample of zirconium selenomolybdate was chosen for characteri-zation  (via  IR,  thermal  analysis,  XRD,  and  FESEM)  and    further    preparation    and    quality    control    of    99Mo\/99mTc  generator.

{"id":1350,"text":"The solvent extraction of the 90Y\/90Sr pair from carbonate media with mixtures of aromatic dihydroxy compounds and a quaternary ammonium salt—methyltrioctylammonium carbonate (MTOAC)—in toluene and butyl acetate was studied. It was found that MTOAC increases the distribution coeffi  cients of both the extractant itself and its solvate with yttrium due to the formation of a mixed complex of yttrium and a dihydroxyaromatic ligand with MTOAC. During extraction from alkaline carbonate media in the pH range of 12–13.5 with mixtures of 0.01 M 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 0.015 M MTOAC in butyl acetate or toluene, the distribution coeffi  cients of yttrium exceed 80; the separation factors of the 90Y\/90Sr pair under these conditions are more than 105. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids can be used for the complete stripping of yttrium. The studied mixtures are chemically stable and do not change the extraction properties upon multiple extraction\/stripping cycles.

{"id":1351,"text":"The  isotope 90Sr,  formed  during  the  fi ssion  of uranium  and  plutonium  nuclei,  together  with 137Cs makes  the  main  contribution  to  the  global  pollution of  water  and  soil  on  Earth.  Atmospheric  nuclear testing in 1945–1980 released 1018 Bq of 90Sr into the environment,  the  Chernobyl  disaster  in  1986  added 1016 Bq, the explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011 added another 1015 Bq. The high migratory mobility  of 90Sr  brings  about  its  distribution  in  the biosphere and the inevitable entry into the organisms of  living  beings,  where  it  concentrates  in  the  bones and  damages  the  surrounding  tissues.  The  obvious need for constant monitoring of the 90Sr content in the environment  is  complicated  by  its  nuclear-physical properties. Unlike 137Cs, which is easily detected by the γ-radiation of the 137Ba daughter, both 90Sr and the 90Y daughter are pure β-emitters (90Sr with Emax = 546 keV and 90Y with Emax = 2280 keV). Classical methods of analysis involve the chemical separation of 90Sr from the  matrix  material,  exposure  until  equilibrium  with 90Y, and its determination by hard β-radiation. Liquid–liquid  extraction  is  widely  used  for  the  separation  of radionuclides. Strontium-90 is effi  ciently and selectively extracted from nitric acid media by crown ethers [1]. Alkyl phosphoric acids can be used to extract 90Y from acidic media [2].

{"id":1395,"text":"For preparing materials of pure transplutonium ele-ments (TPE), ion exchange is widely used in radiochem-ical practice. In ion exchange chromatography, the sepa-ration is based on the selectivity of the ion exchange resin  with  respect  to  the  counterions  of  the  mixture. When separating ions with very similar properties [for example, rare earth elements (REE)], most ion exchange resins exhibit almost the same affi  nity relative to ions close to each other. Separation of rare-earth elements by elution from a column containing a cation exchange resin with a solution of a strong, non-chelating acid is practically  impossible,  since  their  distribution  coeffi  -cients diff er little from each other [4]. If you choose a chelating agent that, with the ions of the mixture gives complex compounds of various strengths, then success-ful separation of the ions becomes possible. The stron-ger the complex formed in solution by the counterion, the less this ion will be absorbed by the ion exchange resin. Thus, the separation completeness of the mixture components  can  be  enhanced.  The  chelating  reagent α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (α-HIBA) and its salts (main-ly ammonium) are used in ion-exchange processes of intra- and intergroup separation of REE and TPE radio-nuclides of [5–17]. Cation exchange methods are used to separate REE and TPE radionuclides by elution with solutions  containing  α-HIBA  and  its  salts.  Strongly acidic styrene–divinylbenzene sulfonic cation exchange resins, such as Dowex 50W-X8, Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8, and a number of their other analogues, are utilized as sorbents [6, 10, 12–16]. As a rule, in the technique used [5, 6, 9–12], trivalent actinides are fi rst adsorbed from a dilute (<0.5 M) HNO3 solution on a cation exchange resin. Then the sorbent is converted into the NH4+ form, and  the  actinides  are  eluted  with  a  chelating  reagent (α-HIBA). It was noted in [8, 14] that, without prelimi-nary conversion of the cation exchange resin to the am-monium form by eluating with an α-HIBA ammonium salt solution, the released H+ ions have a strong inhibi-tory eff ect on poorly sorbed elements, such as Cf.","entities":[{"id":11916,"label":"Resin","start_offset":1516,"end_offset":1528},{"id":11917,"label":"Resin","start_offset":1530,"end_offset":1547},{"id":11918,"label":"Resin","start_offset":1758,"end_offset":1779},{"id":11919,"label":"Element","start_offset":2157,"end_offset":2159},{"id":11920,"label":"Resin","start_offset":203,"end_offset":221},{"id":11921,"label":"Resin","start_offset":375,"end_offset":394},{"id":11924,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1163,"end_offset":1168},{"id":11925,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1178,"end_offset":1186},{"id":11926,"label":"Acid","start_offset":1410,"end_offset":1416},{"id":11927,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1428,"end_offset":1433},{"id":11930,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1676,"end_offset":1695},{"id":11931,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1820,"end_offset":1823},{"id":11932,"label":"Acid","start_offset":1894,"end_offset":1900},{"id":11933,"label":"Resin","start_offset":1972,"end_offset":1993},{"id":11934,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":2001,"end_offset":2010},{"id":11935,"label":"Acid","start_offset":2036,"end_offset":2042},{"id":11936,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":2043,"end_offset":2056},{"id":11937,"label":"Resin","start_offset":540,"end_offset":561},{"id":11938,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1300,"end_offset":1323},{"id":11939,"label":"Resin","start_offset":996,"end_offset":1014},{"id":11940,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":1729,"end_offset":1743},{"id":11941,"label":"Element","start_offset":2080,"end_offset":2081},{"id":15660,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":64,"end_offset":76},{"id":15661,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":122,"end_offset":150},{"id":15662,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1121,"end_offset":1145},{"id":15663,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1153},{"id":15664,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1200,"end_offset":1223},{"id":15665,"label":"Resin","start_offset":1452,"end_offset":1506},{"id":15666,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":1841,"end_offset":1852},{"id":15667,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":27,"end_offset":56},{"id":15668,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":58,"end_offset":61},{"id":15669,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":342,"end_offset":361},{"id":15670,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":363,"end_offset":366},{"id":15671,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":482,"end_offset":501},{"id":15672,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":1262,"end_offset":1266},{"id":15673,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":1270,"end_offset":1273}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1419,"text":"On the output elution curve of 248Cm (Fig. 4), the leading edge is more diff use than in experiments with indicator  amounts  of  this  element  (Fig.  3).  Based  on the data in [10], this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the distribution coeffi  cient of Cm probably increases with a rise in its concentration. The relation-ship between the amount of a substance sorbed from the liquid phase and its concentration in this phase at a con-stant temperature is expressed by the sorption isotherm. At low concentrations, the amount of sorbed substance is proportional to its concentration in the liquid phase, and a linear sorption isotherm is observed (the distribu-tion coeffi  cient does not depend on the concentration of the substance in the liquid phase). Each component of the zone moves at a constant rate, since the linear rate of its migration depends on the fl ow rate of the mobile phase, which is set constant. The entire zone moves with the same rate, remaining symmetrical: the concentration of the component is maximum in the center of the zone and decreases symmetrically towards the edges. There-fore, the peak on the chromatogram is also symmetrical (Figs. 1–3). If for high concentrations of a substance the distribution coeffi  cient is greater than for low concentra-tions, then the center of the zone with a higher concentra-tion moves more slowly than the edges of the zone with a low concentration (concave sorption isotherm). As a result, the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred and the peak is asymmetric. Since the leading edge of the chromatographic peak is blurred when Am and Cf are removed from Am and Cf (Fig. 4), it can be assumed that the Cm sorption isotherm has a concave character. For a concave isotherm, the chromatographic peak has an asymmetric shape with a diff use leading edge; the retained volume increases with increasing ion concentration.","entities":[{"id":12169,"label":"Element","start_offset":31,"end_offset":36},{"id":12170,"label":"Element","start_offset":269,"end_offset":271},{"id":12171,"label":"Element","start_offset":1626,"end_offset":1628},{"id":12172,"label":"Element","start_offset":1633,"end_offset":1635},{"id":12173,"label":"Element","start_offset":1653,"end_offset":1655},{"id":12174,"label":"Element","start_offset":1660,"end_offset":1662},{"id":12175,"label":"Element","start_offset":1700,"end_offset":1702},{"id":15677,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1158},{"id":15678,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1499,"end_offset":1519},{"id":15679,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1589,"end_offset":1609},{"id":15680,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1774,"end_offset":1794}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Thus, the possibility of selective separation of americium from HLW for its subsequent transmutation in fast reactors was demonstrated.","entities":[{"id":12978,"label":"Element","start_offset":36,"end_offset":43},{"id":12979,"label":"Element","start_offset":47,"end_offset":53},{"id":12980,"label":"Element","start_offset":75,"end_offset":80},{"id":12981,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":130,"end_offset":147},{"id":12982,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":170,"end_offset":178},{"id":12983,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":179,"end_offset":190},{"id":12984,"label":"Element","start_offset":248,"end_offset":257},{"id":12985,"label":"Element","start_offset":262,"end_offset":269},{"id":12986,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":335,"end_offset":347},{"id":12987,"label":"Element","start_offset":391,"end_offset":401},{"id":12988,"label":"Element","start_offset":408,"end_offset":413},{"id":12989,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":505,"end_offset":542},{"id":12991,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":646,"end_offset":654},{"id":12992,"label":"Element","start_offset":670,"end_offset":673},{"id":12993,"label":"Element","start_offset":677,"end_offset":680},{"id":12994,"label":"Yield","start_offset":684,"end_offset":703},{"id":12995,"label":"Element","start_offset":739,"end_offset":741},{"id":12996,"label":"Element","start_offset":760,"end_offset":763},{"id":12997,"label":"Element","start_offset":767,"end_offset":769},{"id":12998,"label":"Element","start_offset":809,"end_offset":811},{"id":12999,"label":"Element","start_offset":817,"end_offset":820},{"id":13000,"label":"Element","start_offset":824,"end_offset":827},{"id":13001,"label":"Element","start_offset":890,"end_offset":900},{"id":15977,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":608,"end_offset":643}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1497,"text":"There are several approaches to the separation of Am from Cm and lanthanides, and most of them are based on extraction methods [7, 8]. The key diff erence between these cations is that americium can be oxidized to higher oxidation states Am(V,VI), which changes its extraction behavior [9, 10]. Previously, in our works [11, 12], it was  shown  that,  generating Am(VI)  in  weakly  acidic solutions  makes  it  possible  to  extract  Cm(III)  from their mixture using the extractants 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoylpyrosolone-5  and  trioctylphosphine  oxide, while Am(VI), being reduced by the organic phase to Am(V), remains in the aqueous solution. At the same time, the use of these extractants in industrial conditions is  challenging.  For  this  reason,  it  was  proposed  [13] to use TBP as a reliable and well-tested extractant in the technology to solve the problem of separating Am from Cm. For example, curium was extracted almost quantitatively from solutions containing ≤0.1 M HNO3and ~8 M NH4NO3 using 30% TBP in Isopar-M, while americium was only partially (≤30%) transferred to the organic phase in the Am(III) form.

{"id":1509,"text":"We preliminarily studied the extraction of Am(VI) and trivalent Cm and Pr from 0.1 M HNO3 in the pres-ence  of  8  M  NH4NO3  with  30%  TBP  in  Isopar-M (Table 1). It can be seen from the data in Table 1 that both trivalent Cm and Pr and Am(VI) are extracted to a high degree (up to 95 wt %) under the conditions of the study. The distribution coeffi  cients (D) of Am(VI), Cm(III), and Pr(III) per an extraction were about 2.5, 3.6, and 1.8, respectively. DAm(VI) = 2.5 correlates with the data of [21], where the maximum distribution co-effi  cient was achieved at 4 M HNO3 and the minimum phase contact time, and, however, it was slightly lower than in [16], where 100% TBP was used for extraction. Spectrophotometric method was applied to prove that Am(VI) in organic phase is reduced mainly to Am(V) and partially to Am(III), and after 1 day storage, Am(V) completely transforms into Am(III). However, in some works, contradictions were noted regarding the stability of Am(VI) in the presence of TBP. Thus, the authors of [14, 16] point to the relative stability of Am in the or-ganic phase, while it was stated in [21] that contact with organic phase led to a rapid americium reduction result-ing in a lower D(Am) than expected. Thus, from the data in Table 1, it can be concluded that Am(VI), as well as trivalent Cm and Pr, is successfully extracted with 30% TBP in Isopar-M from 0.1 M HNO3 in the presence of NH4NO3 salting-out agent. Therefore, this approach to the separation of Am(VI) from Cm and lanthanides un-der these conditions is technologically unrealizable.","entities":[{"id":13177,"label":"Element","start_offset":42,"end_offset":49},{"id":13178,"label":"Element","start_offset":64,"end_offset":67},{"id":13179,"label":"Element","start_offset":71,"end_offset":74},{"id":13180,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":79,"end_offset":89},{"id":13181,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":112,"end_offset":124},{"id":13182,"label":"Element","start_offset":226,"end_offset":229},{"id":13183,"label":"Element","start_offset":233,"end_offset":236},{"id":13184,"label":"Element","start_offset":240,"end_offset":246},{"id":13185,"label":"Element","start_offset":368,"end_offset":374},{"id":13186,"label":"Element","start_offset":376,"end_offset":383},{"id":13187,"label":"Element","start_offset":389,"end_offset":396},{"id":13188,"label":"Element","start_offset":460,"end_offset":466},{"id":13189,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":569,"end_offset":577},{"id":13190,"label":"Element","start_offset":756,"end_offset":762},{"id":13191,"label":"Element","start_offset":801,"end_offset":806},{"id":13192,"label":"Element","start_offset":824,"end_offset":831},{"id":13193,"label":"Element","start_offset":858,"end_offset":863},{"id":13194,"label":"Element","start_offset":891,"end_offset":898},{"id":13195,"label":"Element","start_offset":977,"end_offset":983},{"id":13196,"label":"Element","start_offset":1073,"end_offset":1076},{"id":13197,"label":"Element","start_offset":1218,"end_offset":1220},{"id":13198,"label":"Element","start_offset":1294,"end_offset":1300},{"id":13199,"label":"Element","start_offset":1323,"end_offset":1326},{"id":13200,"label":"Element","start_offset":1330,"end_offset":1332},{"id":13202,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":1390,"end_offset":1400},{"id":13203,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1420,"end_offset":1427},{"id":13204,"label":"Element","start_offset":1492,"end_offset":1498},{"id":13205,"label":"Element","start_offset":1504,"end_offset":1507},{"id":13207,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":670,"end_offset":678},{"id":13208,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":704,"end_offset":729},{"id":13209,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":1003,"end_offset":1006},{"id":13210,"label":"Element","start_offset":1174,"end_offset":1184},{"id":13214,"label":"Element Group","start_offset":1511,"end_offset":1523},{"id":15688,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1365,"end_offset":1372},{"id":15689,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":1375,"end_offset":1384},{"id":15690,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":132,"end_offset":140},{"id":15691,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":146,"end_offset":154}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1573,"text":"To determine the fuel weight at the first stage, the sample with the fuel element cladding was weighed. Upon completion of the fuel dissolution, the cladding was removed, washed, dried, and weighed. The fuel weight content in the sample was found from the difference between the weight of the sample with the fuel element cladding and the cladding weight. The weight of the sample and fuel cladding after dissolution was found on an analytical balance AX 205 (Mettler Toledo) with a weighing error of ±0.25 mg. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of KETVS-1 was carried out in an apparatus (Fig. 1) [4]. The first trap is designed to capture ruthenium released during the dissolution of the SNF sample, the second is to absorb iodine isotopes, and three alkaline absorbers are to trap 14C released in the form of carbon dioxide. The purging rate of the apparatus volume with air was 1.2 L h–1. The dissolution of the fuel sample irradiated as part of combined experimental fuel assembly KETVS-7 was carried out in a dissolution apparatus (Fig. 2). The purging rate of the apparatus volume with an ozone–air mixture was 1.2 L h–1, which corresponds to an ozone supply rate of 2.5 × 10–2 g h–1. The change in the device design is due to the results of radiochemical studies of the MNUP SNF irradiated as part of KETVS-1, and a series of model experiments to prove the completeness of the oxidation of various carbon forms to CO2 and the capture of the resulting carbon dioxide by alkaline traps [3], as well as the results of testing KETVS-1 for the content of iodine isotopes.","entities":[{"id":13807,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":432,"end_offset":459},{"id":13808,"label":"Element","start_offset":660,"end_offset":670},{"id":13809,"label":"Element","start_offset":745,"end_offset":752},{"id":13810,"label":"Element","start_offset":803,"end_offset":807},{"id":13811,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":831,"end_offset":845},{"id":13814,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1172,"end_offset":1178},{"id":13815,"label":"Element","start_offset":1425,"end_offset":1432},{"id":13816,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1441,"end_offset":1445},{"id":13817,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":1478,"end_offset":1492},{"id":13818,"label":"Element","start_offset":1577,"end_offset":1584}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

The excess of the U content in the upper filter compared to the lower filter may indicate the presence of undissolved uranium-containing compounds.

Our data on the tritium specific activity in the fuel cladding agree with the results of [17], where the tritium specific activity in the fuel cladding with uranium oxide fuel and burn-up of 6.6–7.1% was 1.2 × 105 Bq\/g. At the same time, it was found in [18] that the tritium content in the fuel element cladding of the VVER-440 reactor has a significant spread and is in the range from 3.9 × 106 to 3.4 × 107 Bq\/g. The authors note that the uneven distribution of tritium is observed both along the height and along the circumference of the fuel-element cladding. They conclude that the main part of the tritium enters the cladding through areas of a damaged protective zirconium oxide film.","entities":[{"id":14095,"label":"Element","start_offset":68,"end_offset":75},{"id":14096,"label":"Element","start_offset":180,"end_offset":187},{"id":14097,"label":"Element","start_offset":261,"end_offset":268},{"id":14098,"label":"Element","start_offset":369,"end_offset":376},{"id":14099,"label":"Element","start_offset":458,"end_offset":465},{"id":14100,"label":"Chemical Compound","start_offset":510,"end_offset":523},{"id":14101,"label":"Yield","start_offset":557,"end_offset":571},{"id":14102,"label":"Element","start_offset":621,"end_offset":628},{"id":14103,"label":"Element","start_offset":958,"end_offset":965},{"id":14104,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1024,"end_offset":1044},{"id":15982,"label":"Element","start_offset":818,"end_offset":826}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

At a P507 concentration of 15% (0.45 M), the maximum saturation of the extract with ytterbium tends to 0.075 M (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the molar ratio of REE : P507 = 1 : 6 in the organic phase and to Eq.

{"id":1615,"text":"A number of radiotracers involving 64Cu as radionuclide have been applied in nuclear medicine as a means of studying their PET imaging [4,5,6]. Incorporation of 64Cu into diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (ATSM) ligand was used for PET hypoxia imaging, such as in head and neck cancer, and cardiac conditions [7,8]. More radiotracers are in clinical development [9,10,11,12], especially those with peptides and antibodies. For example, 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was used to conduct PET imaging of HER2-positive lesions in patients with primary and metastatic breast cancer [13]. The PET image of 64Cu-DOTATATE provided superior image quality, and detected more lesions than 111In-DTPA-octreotide [14]. Grubmüller, B. et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of 64Cu-PSMA-617 in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma [15]. 64Cu has been produced at many centers [16,17,18,19]. Among the nuclear reactions examined, the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu method is the best and widely used, since high production yield of the 64Cu can be obtained with low energy protons in this route [20,21]. At Washington University, an effective method was investigated to produce high specific activity 64Cu on a small biomedical cyclotron using the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction, and 64Cu has been produced for more than 17 years by the irradiation of electroplated enriched 64Ni targets in this center [20,22]. The Turku PET Centre has been producing 64Cu since 2008 using 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu reaction, and also handles the irradiated target, radioactive liquids and gases using automated equipment [23,24]. At the University of Wisconsin, 64Cu and 61Co radionuclides have been simultaneously produced using the 64Ni (p, n) 64Cu nuclear reaction on a low energy proton-only cyclotron [25]. Ohya, T. et al.

In addition, the identity of radioactivity of the produced 64Cu was further confirmed by measurement of its half-life, by measuring radioactivity at different time points. A decayed sample from the produced 64Cu was also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for traces of metallic impurities. To assess the quality of the produced 64Cu (quantity, specific activity and purity), the synthesis of a radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was performed. Here, the site-specific modification of monoclonal antibody DOTA-rituximab which contains two DOTA chelator in each antibody was used as we previously reported [29]. The 64CuCl2 solution prepared above was reacted with DOTA-rituximab in a solution of pH = 5.5 at RT for 30 min. After incubation, the radiotracer was purified using a PD-10 desalting column, and characterized by Radio-TLC and Radio-HPLC, to determine the labeling yield and radiochemical purity. The identity of the radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab, was further evaluated by PET imaging, which was carried out on a micro-PET rodent model scanner as reported earlier [29]. After formulation, 64Cu-DOTA-rituximab (0.5 mCi) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the mice bearing Ramos RA1 tumors (n = 3), which overexpress CD20 antigen, and the animals were imaged with micro-PET at both 24 and 60 h post-injection.","entities":[{"id":14578,"label":"Organic solvent","start_offset":53,"end_offset":69},{"id":14579,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":90,"end_offset":107},{"id":14580,"label":"Element","start_offset":201,"end_offset":205},{"id":14581,"label":"Element","start_offset":349,"end_offset":354},{"id":14582,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":375,"end_offset":419},{"id":14583,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":421,"end_offset":427},{"id":14584,"label":"Element","start_offset":502,"end_offset":507},{"id":14585,"label":"Element","start_offset":553,"end_offset":579},{"id":14586,"label":"Element","start_offset":581,"end_offset":585},{"id":14592,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":787,"end_offset":803},{"id":14595,"label":"pH","start_offset":868,"end_offset":876},{"id":14596,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":950,"end_offset":972},{"id":14597,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":995,"end_offset":1004},{"id":14598,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1009,"end_offset":1019},{"id":14599,"label":"Element","start_offset":1112,"end_offset":1116},{"id":14602,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1158,"end_offset":1169},{"id":14603,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1197,"end_offset":1228},{"id":14604,"label":"Element","start_offset":1274,"end_offset":1278},{"id":14607,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":1461,"end_offset":1470},{"id":15898,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":245,"end_offset":312},{"id":15899,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":586,"end_offset":600},{"id":15900,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":677,"end_offset":691},{"id":15901,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":711,"end_offset":716},{"id":15902,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":836,"end_offset":850},{"id":15903,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1117,"end_offset":1131},{"id":15904,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1279,"end_offset":1293}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1627,"text":"Radiopharmaceuticals are clinically useful for the diagnosis and treatment of disease [1,2,3,4,5]. However, quantifying radiopharmaceuticals’ dosimetry is challenging [6]. Matching diagnostic radionuclides with chemically similar therapeutics creates a “theranostic” pair, helping to resolve this problem [7]. The success of theranostic pairs has led to the re-evaluation of several radionuclides as potential radiopharmaceuticals, with the most popular in recent times being gallium-68 (t1\/2 = 68 min, β+ = 89%, Emax= 1899 keV) and lutetium-177 (t1\/2 = 6.7 d, Eβ- = 134 keV) [8]. The availability of both gallium-68 and lutetium-177 and the success of conjugating a myriad of targeting vectors to them have led to their widespread adoption in the nuclear medicine community. However, several shortcomings exist for these two radionuclides; namely, the short half-life of gallium-68 limits the range of its applicability, and the resistance of some cancers to lutetium-177-labelled radiopharmaceuticals has prompted a search for other therapeutic radionuclides [9]. Additionally, although gallium-68 and lutetium-177 have been used as a theranostic pair, slight chemical differences between the two may complicate dosimetric calculations and\/or lead to subtle biological incongruities [10]. Using compounds labelled with the same chemical element can obviate this problem and allow the same protocols to be used in forming and purifying chemical complexes [11]. Cobalt-55 (t1\/2 = 17.53 h, β+ = 77%, Eγ = 931.1 keV, Iγ = 75%) and cobalt-58m (t1\/2 = 9.10 h, IC= 100%) are one of the most promising of such pairs identified due to their identical chemical properties coupled to similar half-lives and high in vivo stability and compatibility with many chelators which can be coupled with targeting biomolecules [8,12,13,14,15,16,17].

Practically speaking, clinical application will always have to carefully consider target isotopic enrichment, but target fabrication and recovery are well developed (and reported) processes. These processes are described in greater detail below, treating the nuclear reactions relevant to each radionuclide separately. It should be stated that all radiation decay information comes from Brookhaven National Lab NuDat database [17]. Cobalt-55 production was reported in 1938 from alpha irradiation of manganese [18] and has since been reported from many target materials and incident beams.

{"id":1631,"text":"Irradiating isotopically enriched iron-58 avoids the production of other impurities that cannot be separated out in the downstream chemistry. Natural iron is composed of iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%), and iron-58 (0.3%). Proton bombardment of iron-54 leads to the production of very short-lived contaminants such as 54Fe(p,n)54Co (t1\/2 = 1.46 m) and 54Fe(p,2n)53Co (t1\/2 = 0.24 s) that do not diminish the radioisotopic purity of cobalt-58m. However, higher-energy proton reactions on iron-56 and iron-57, as described above for iron-58, may form longer-lived radioisotopic impurities cobalt-56 and cobalt-57. Measured data from the relevant excitation functions are shown below in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Deuteron bombardments can be used to produce cobalt-58m from enriched iron-57 via the (d,n) reaction, natural iron targets via the (d,n) reaction on iron-57 (2.2% abundance) or (d,2n) reaction on iron-56 (91.7%). Higher stopping power for deuterons reduces the quantity of isotopically enriched target material required, and deuteron-induced reactions’ excitation functions are often higher than similar reactions incited by proton beams.

Accelerators with deuteron beams are also less common, and where they do exist, they usually have energies too low to utilize the entirety of even (d,n) excitation functions. Deuteron irradiations to produce cobalt-58m proceed on iron isotopes iron-57 and iron-58, which both exist in relatively low abundance, so as with proton irradiations, significant costs are associated with target materials.","entities":[{"id":14720,"label":"Element","start_offset":34,"end_offset":41},{"id":14721,"label":"Element","start_offset":150,"end_offset":154},{"id":14722,"label":"Element","start_offset":170,"end_offset":177},{"id":14723,"label":"Element","start_offset":186,"end_offset":193},{"id":14724,"label":"Element","start_offset":203,"end_offset":210},{"id":14725,"label":"Element","start_offset":223,"end_offset":230},{"id":14726,"label":"Element","start_offset":260,"end_offset":268},{"id":14727,"label":"Element","start_offset":334,"end_offset":338},{"id":14728,"label":"Element","start_offset":343,"end_offset":347},{"id":14729,"label":"Element","start_offset":368,"end_offset":372},{"id":14730,"label":"Element","start_offset":378,"end_offset":382},{"id":14731,"label":"Element","start_offset":447,"end_offset":458},{"id":14732,"label":"Element","start_offset":503,"end_offset":510},{"id":14733,"label":"Element","start_offset":515,"end_offset":522},{"id":14734,"label":"Element","start_offset":547,"end_offset":554},{"id":14735,"label":"Element","start_offset":603,"end_offset":612},{"id":14736,"label":"Element","start_offset":617,"end_offset":626},{"id":14737,"label":"Element","start_offset":768,"end_offset":778},{"id":14738,"label":"Element","start_offset":792,"end_offset":800},{"id":14739,"label":"Element","start_offset":833,"end_offset":837},{"id":14740,"label":"Element","start_offset":871,"end_offset":879},{"id":14741,"label":"Element","start_offset":919,"end_offset":926},{"id":14742,"label":"Element","start_offset":1487,"end_offset":1497},{"id":14743,"label":"Element","start_offset":1509,"end_offset":1513},{"id":14744,"label":"Element","start_offset":1523,"end_offset":1530},{"id":14745,"label":"Element","start_offset":1535,"end_offset":1542},{"id":15988,"label":"Element","start_offset":723,"end_offset":732},{"id":15989,"label":"Element","start_offset":962,"end_offset":972},{"id":15990,"label":"Element","start_offset":1048,"end_offset":1056},{"id":15991,"label":"Element","start_offset":1297,"end_offset":1306},{"id":15992,"label":"Element","start_offset":1237,"end_offset":1246},{"id":15993,"label":"Element","start_offset":1454,"end_offset":1463}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

These are the only reactions whose literature descriptions include thick target yield measurements obtained in conjunction with radiochemical separations and radiolabeling efforts. A comparison of the experimentally determined thick target yields and theoretical yields are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16. As mentioned above, the co-production of cobalt-58g with cobalt-58m is unavoidable.

This impurity poses an issue to the application of cobalt-58m due its long half-life and concomitant gamma emissions [88]. However, cobalt-58g can be useful for PET imaging of the biodistribution of radiolabeled agents. This potentially allows for determination of these agents’ biodistribution at timepoints many days after injection [89].

{"id":1636,"text":"Using the table above, it can be suggested that for the production of cobalt-55, iron-54 targets should be utilized based on the lack of potential long-lived radio-contaminants co-produced, and an increased yield at lower thickness targets when compared to yields produced by nickel-58. To determine the best route for producing Co-58m, one has to consider accelerator capabilities, target material expenses and also potential co-produced contaminants. From Table 2, it would appear that producing Co-58m from Mn-51 would be the most economically feasible due to the 100% abundance of Mn-51. However, many biomedical accelerators do not have the ability to produce an alpha particle beam. Therefore, iron-57 targets are suggested to produce cobalt-58m via the d,n reaction due to the higher cross section compared to the other two methods discussed using proton irradiation.

{"id":1638,"text":"Iron electroplating methods are largely adapted from Vosburgh et al. [89,92]. Metallic iron-5x powder is dissolved in 5 mL 6M HCl. To the dissolved iron solution, 100 µL of 30% H2O2 is added to promote the oxidation of iron 2+ ions in solution to 3+ ions. This solution is then dried to near completion, leaving <1 mL of solution in the dry down vessel. The residual solution is then diluted with 15 mL of saturated ammonium oxalate with a concentration of ~44 mg\/mL H2O. From here, Valdovinos adjusts the pH of the solution between 2 and 3 with either 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl [26]. However, Graves et al. uses an additional step of adding <100 mg of L-ascorbic acid to the saturated ammonium oxalate target solution to promote the reduction of iron 3+ ions to iron 2+ ions [93]. This solution is then adjusted to ~pH 3 before transferring to electroplating cell. Thisgaard et al. explains a different method for electroplating iron powder, adapted from Zaman and Qaim [28]. In this method, iron powder is dissolved in 1 mL of H2SO4 under nitrogen-atmosphere. once dissolved, the solution is diluted with distilled water to 5 mL in order to have a pH of 1.5. This solution is then used for the plating process on a silver backing, where the current density is reported as 28–35 mA\/cm2 for 1.5 h with a fixed voltage of 7.3 V. [87]. Another form of target fabrication is to press elemental enriched iron into 5 mm diameter pellets. Enriched iron material can come in the form of Fe2O3.

{"id":1640,"text":" Anion-exchange chromatography also isolates cobalt-5x from iron target material [94]. After dissolving the target in acid, the iron is oxidized into the 3+ state with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of loading the cobalt-5x on to the anion-exchange resin and washing away the target material, as was performed in the nickel\/cobalt anion-exchange separation, cobalt and iron are retained on the column when loaded. The cobalt can then be eluted form the anion-exchange column in 4 M HCl. The iron target will remain on the column during the 4 M HCl wash, but can be recovered in low concentrations of HCl. The HCl eluant containing cobalt-5x can also be evaporated and the cobalt-5x reconstituted in alternative matrices without incurring significant losses [26,28,86,87]. Separation of cobalt-5x from manganese is similar to the isolation of cobalt-5x from nickel targets, but can use even less concentrated acidic media. As summarized by Bate and Leddicotte in “The Radiochemistry of Cobalt”, manganese in a dissolved target solution passes through a AG1 × 8 anion-exchange resin in HCl concentrations > 4.5 HCl.

{"id":1641,"text":"As stated by Valdovinos et al., it is preferrable to use extraction chromatography instead of traditional ion exchange resins to increase separation yield and purity level [26]. This realization allowed for the implementation of N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis-2-ethylhexyldiglycolamide (DGA Branched extraction resin). The most recent published separation methods from both nickel and iron targets of varying enrichments use branched DGA to chemically isolate radioactive cobalt. The newer separation method for separating nickel from cobalt is straightforward, using one column containing branched DGA resin, as shown in Figure 17. The separation of cobalt-5x from iron-5x uses a two column technique, as shown in Figure 18. An AG1X8 anion-exchange resin packed column is used for the bulk separation of iron and cobalt, then a DGA column serves as a “clean up” to further improve the purification of cobalt-5x [26]. While there has not been a publication specifically on the separation of manganese target material from cobalt-55,58m, the work performed by Pourmand et al. suggests branched DGA can also be used for radio-chemical isolation using 4–6 M HCl, where in this range manganese 2+ has minimal affinity for the resin, and cobalt 2+ has a greater affinity [95]. While not widely used for radiochemistry, early studies showed that cobalt can be separated from iron 3+ and nickel 2+ with the use of inorganic and organic absorbents [94]. Many of the inorganic separations were using alumina, a polar column chromatography absorbent [96].

{"id":1642,"text":"Free cobalt in the form of cobalt 2+ has been found to behave in the body similarly to calcium 2+ [97].

Additionally, uptake in ischemic regions of the brain occurs regardless of whether the blood brain barrier remains intact [100]. The somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors that contain somatostatin-binding extracellular domains [101]. Somatostatin (SST) is a 14 amino acid peptide involved in neurotransmission and cell proliferation [101]. While most normal cell types express somatostatin receptors, several tumor types overexpress the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) [102].

{"id":1643,"text":"The first agent approved for PET imaging of SSTR2 was [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE (Netspot) in 2016 [104]. Since its approval, there has been interest in developing a PET agent for somatostatin receptor imaging with a longer half-life than gallium-68 to simplify patient logistics and to image longer time courses post injection with improved clearance from blood and non-target tissues. In a study published in 2008, Heppeler et al. investigated the effect of changing the metal ion on the affinity of DOTATOC for SSTR analogs and compared their results to those published by Reubi et al. [105,106]. They found that Co-DOTATOC has higher affinity than DOTATOC labeled with gallium and yttrium as well as octreotide [106]. Biodistribution studies of [57Co]Co-DOTATOC in mice with AR42J tumors revealed high (25% ID\/g) tumor uptake at 4 h post injection (PI), even higher than the kidneys which are a clearance route for peptides. However, the tumor to kidney ratio did not increase at the 24 h timepoint. Crystallography with Ga- and Co-DOTA revealed similar pseudooctahedral geometry but differing charge states which may explain their differing binding affinities [106].

{"id":1644,"text":"Thisgaard et al. followed this work with a comparative in vivo evaluation of 57Co-labeled DOTATOC, DOTANOC, and DOTATATE with [111In]In-DOTATATE [107]. In a head-to-head comparison in AR42J cells, the three 57Co-labeled somatostatin analogues were found to have between 49 and 123% higher cellular uptake as compared to [111In]In-DOTATATE. All agents showed similar levels of nuclear translocation, with less than 10% of nuclear translocation observed up to 3 h post addition. The cell-killing ability of the Auger emitter [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was also compared to the beta emitter [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE and the Auger emitter [111In]In-DOTATATE. At low concentrations, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was more effective in causing DNA damage than 111In-labeled or 177Lu-labeled, while at higher concentrations the [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was most effective. When the cell-killing assay was normalized to cumulative decays, the [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE was consistently most effective at all concentrations tested. The authors attributed the limited degree of cell killing demonstrated by lutetium-177 to the cells being grown in monolayer, which restricts the ability of the emitted electrons to cross into adjacent cells to do damage. The superiority of 58mCo-over 111In-labeled DOTATATE may also be attributed to the higher binding affinity of the cobalt-labeled DOTATATE for SSTR2. Similarly to the 2008 study, the authors performed a biodistribution study with [57Co]Co-DOTATATE and found high tumor uptake 1–4 h PI.

{"id":1645,"text":"In a paper published by Andersen et al. in 2020 [15], [55Co]Co-DOTATATE was compared with [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE and [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE to evaluate tumor uptake and image quality. Tumor-bearing mice were imaged 1, 4, and 24 h post injection of the 55Co- or 64Cu-labeled DOTATATE, while [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE imaging was only performed at 1 h post injection (PI) (see Figure 19 below). Authors found that at 1 h PI both the 55Co- and 64Cu-labeled agents showed a nonsignificant trend towards higher uptake than [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. Tumor to organ ratios increased for [55Co]Co-DOTATATE at the 4 h and 24 h PI imaging times, with ratios of tumor to liver, kidney, and muscle higher than [64Cu]Cu-DOTATATE. PET imaging showed that for all 3 agents, blood activity had mostly cleared by 1 h PI. For the [55Co]Co-DOTATATE, kidneys and liver did not appear on the images at 4 and 24 h PI, while liver uptake was apparent in the 64Cu-labeled version at 24 h PI. The authors also used the mouse biodistribution to estimate human dosimetry. They found that most organs would receive relatively low doses from [55Co]Co-DOTATATE (<0.2 × 10−2 mSv\/MBq), while the lungs (6.5 × 10−2 mSv\/MBq) and stomach (2.1 × 10−2 mSv\/MBq) would receive higher doses. In summary, it appears that cobalt-labeled somatostatin receptor-targeted agents have the highest affinity ever observed for SSTR2. DOTATATE labeled with cobalt-55 shows improved imaging characteristics as compared to DOTATATE labeled with copper-64 as nontarget uptake in the liver is reduced. As a therapeutic, [58mCo]Co-DOTATATE has shown promise as an effective auger emitter as it is has high affinity for SSTR2 and is internalized to a high degree.

{"id":1651,"text":"Folate receptors (FR) are expressed on the surface of cells and reduce extracellular folic acid derivatives, delivering them across the cell membrane [119]. Their overexpression by many cancers makes them interesting pharmacological targets [119,120]. Radford et al. 55Co-labeled two folate receptor-targeting constructs, cm10 (DOTA tagged) and rf42 (NODAGA tagged) [121]. In vitro and in vivo up uptake waweres evaluated in the KB cervical cancer cell line which expresses high levels of FR [122]. The two agents had similar uptake and biodistributions, achieving >15% ID\/g in xenografted tumors and underwent renal clearance [121]. Compared to a previous study using 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeled rf42, tumor to blood and tumor to kidney ratios were similar for all three agents [123]. However, tumor to liver ratios for the 55Co- and 68Ga-labeled tracers were higher than for the 64Cu-labeled version. Free copper is known to exhibit preferential liver uptake due to high levels of transcuprein [124].  Some of the challenges facing a therapeutic target to folate receptors include the lack of specificity towards folate receptor isoform α versus isoform β. While FRα is primarily expressed by epithelial cancers, it has high expression in the kidneys [125]. FRβ is expressed in adult tissues primarily in immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes [120]. Delivery of a folate receptor-targeted therapy to the tumor while sparing the kidneys has been demonstrated to be a difficult challenge [126]. The constructs cm10 and rf42 each contain an albumin-binding domain which contributes to lowering kidney uptake, which may allow them to be used therapeutically.","entities":[{"id":15150,"label":"Acid","start_offset":85,"end_offset":95},{"id":15151,"label":"Element","start_offset":267,"end_offset":271},{"id":15152,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":328,"end_offset":333},{"id":15153,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":351,"end_offset":358},{"id":15154,"label":"Element","start_offset":820,"end_offset":824},{"id":15155,"label":"Element","start_offset":830,"end_offset":834},{"id":15156,"label":"Element","start_offset":669,"end_offset":673},{"id":15157,"label":"Element","start_offset":679,"end_offset":683},{"id":15158,"label":"Element","start_offset":876,"end_offset":880},{"id":15159,"label":"Element","start_offset":903,"end_offset":910}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1652,"text":"The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a cell surface protein involved in cell growth, replication, angiogenesis and differentiation. It is overexpressed by many breast cancers, and expression status is used to determine eligibility for some therapies [127]. Detection of HER2 receptor status can be assessed with imaging, and [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab has been evaluated in several clinical trials. However, when using a fully intact antibody such as trastuzumab, blood clearance is delayed and imaging is typically performed 4–5 days after injection of the radiotracer [128]. Additionally, use of full-sized antibodies for imaging results in high liver uptake as the antibodies clear through the hepatobiliary pathway. This property may result in obscurement of liver metastases. Use of a truncated antibody, such as a minibody, diabody, or fragment antibody for imaging allows for more rapid clearance, typically via the kidneys [129]. Using these constructs allows for imaging on the same day or next day, which means that a radionuclide with a shorter half-life than zirconium-89 may be preferred. With that in mind, an affibody for HER2 (DOTA-Z2395-C) was developed and 57Co-labeled (as a substitute for cobalt-55) [130]. In vitro studies with the 57Co-labeled HER2 affibody revealed that radiolabeling conditions only slightly reduced immunoreactivity of the affibody. In vitro, approximately 20% of the tracer internalized over 24 h in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, biodistribution was similar to what was observed with [111In]In-DOTA-Z2395-C [131].

SPECT imaging of [57Co]Co-DOTA-Z2395-C at 4 h PI in mice bearing LS174T tumors (low HER2) and SKOV-3 tumors (high HER-2) revealed blockable tumor uptake and kidney clearance [130].","entities":[{"id":15161,"label":"Element","start_offset":348,"end_offset":356},{"id":15162,"label":"Element","start_offset":1088,"end_offset":1101},{"id":15164,"label":"Element","start_offset":1192,"end_offset":1196},{"id":15165,"label":"Element","start_offset":1226,"end_offset":1235},{"id":15166,"label":"Element","start_offset":1270,"end_offset":1274},{"id":15168,"label":"Element","start_offset":1552,"end_offset":1561},{"id":15169,"label":"Element","start_offset":1682,"end_offset":1690},{"id":16027,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":357,"end_offset":369},{"id":16028,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1160,"end_offset":1172},{"id":16030,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1562,"end_offset":1575},{"id":16031,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1690,"end_offset":1703}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

In vitro, incubation of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 with cells expressing low HER3 (DU145) and high HER3 (LS174T) showed better total binding to LS174T (~15% vs. 4% for DU145). Internalization was observed to be higher with the DU145 cells, with approximately 50% of activity internalized by DU145 at 24 h, and less than 10% internalization seen with LS174T. As expected, the high expression line LS174T showed greater tumor binding in vivo, which was effectively blocked with non-labeled ZHER3.

{"id":1654,"text":"Further investigation into the ZHER3 affibody involved modifying the chelator to determine if imaging qualities could be improved [135].

The measured equilibrium disassociation constants, KD, were 0.2 nM for DOTA and DOTAGA constructs and 0.1 nM for the NOTA and NODAGA constructs. Interestingly, the internalization fraction of [57Co]Co-NOTA-ZHER3 in DU145 cells was observed to be 5% over 24 h, while their previous study showed as compared to 50% in their previous study [134]. In vivo, [57Co]Co-(NOTA\/NODAGA\/DOTA\/DOTAGA)-ZHER3 were compared at 3 h and 24 h PI. The DOTA- and DOTAGA-conjugated affibodies showed more rapid blood clearance than those labeled with NOTA and NODAGA. [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was compared to [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 at 3 h post injection and [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 was followed to 24 h (see Figure 21 below). At 3 h, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor uptake but lower blood, liver, and small intestine uptake. By 24 h, [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZHER3 showed similar tumor to organ ratios as 68Ga at 3 h PI [135].

The EGFR-targeting affibody ZEGFR:2377 was conjugated with DOTA for imaging studies and 111In-, 68Ga-, or 57Co-labeled [137,138].

Interestingly [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 outperformed [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 at 3 h PI, showing higher tumor uptake and lower liver and spleen uptake. When biodistribution was performed in mice injected with [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377 at 24 h PI, a reduction in blood activity was observed and was accompanied by only minor reduction in activity in other organs. Similarly, imaging showed much less liver uptake using the 57Co-labeled agent than the 68Ga-labeled agent. This radionuclide-dependent uptake led the authors to speculate that liver binding may be due to more than EGFR targeting in the liver. Because their blocking dose only partly blocked liver binding, they theorize that the neutral charge on the Ga-DOTA complex gives it higher affinity for scavenger receptors in the liver. The reduction in liver binding may leave more affibody available for tumor binding, explaining the higher tumor binding observed with [57Co]Co-DOTA-ZEGFR:2377.","entities":[{"id":15220,"label":"Element","start_offset":410,"end_offset":415},{"id":15221,"label":"Element","start_offset":418,"end_offset":422},{"id":15222,"label":"Element","start_offset":428,"end_offset":432},{"id":15223,"label":"Element","start_offset":452,"end_offset":460},{"id":15225,"label":"Element","start_offset":482,"end_offset":490},{"id":15228,"label":"Element","start_offset":570,"end_offset":578},{"id":15229,"label":"Element","start_offset":608,"end_offset":616},{"id":15232,"label":"Element","start_offset":764,"end_offset":772},{"id":15233,"label":"Element","start_offset":976,"end_offset":980},{"id":15234,"label":"Element","start_offset":1004,"end_offset":1008},{"id":15235,"label":"Element","start_offset":1268,"end_offset":1270},{"id":15238,"label":"Element","start_offset":1482,"end_offset":1489},{"id":16032,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":381,"end_offset":386},{"id":16033,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":462,"end_offset":478},{"id":16034,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":491,"end_offset":506},{"id":16035,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":579,"end_offset":594},{"id":16036,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":617,"end_offset":632},{"id":16037,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":773,"end_offset":789},{"id":16038,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1271,"end_offset":1276},{"id":16039,"label":"Reagent","start_offset":1490,"end_offset":1505}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1663,"text":" Neither crater formation nor peeling off was observed during a thermal shock treatment.   The layer thickness is no longer time-controlled, but governed by the amount of Ag present in the plating bath.    the bath concentrations are held as low as practical considering the requirements of the job. In order to economize, some experiments were carried out with different silver molarities in plating solution. In this work based on the data in Table 5, it seems that the minimum amount of silver in the solution should be 4 g.l–1 to electroplate the layer with 100% current efficiency (Table 4).   Adjusting the bath acidity is important for the effect of bath efficiency and coating physical properties. A large reduction on acidity causes hydrogen reduction and simultaneously sediment of the basis salts on cathode. After preparing the silver bath (while the pH of bath was about 11) for studying the effects of solution the acidity was acidity on electroplating quality, changed from 8.5 to 13. It is clear that the higher current efficiency and the better electrodeposited layers are available in lower acidity than it is in comparison to electrodeposited layers by higher acidity bath (Table 2).  Increasing the temperature of the solution increases the mobility of the ions and reduces the viscosity of the solvent. As a result it reduces concentration polarization and thus enhances the quality of the deposit (fewer tendencies the current to dendrite formation) and efficiency.28 The mean current efficiency was 100% at a current density of 4.27 mA.cm–2, 40–50 °C temperature and time of 2 hours (Table 3).  Silver is a relatively noble metal; most metals being less noble than silver form immersion deposits on the surface. This tends to happen even when the base metal enters the silver solution hot or live, that is, with a voltage already applied.","entities":[{"id":15337,"label":"Element","start_offset":171,"end_offset":174},{"id":15338,"label":"Element","start_offset":372,"end_offset":379},{"id":15339,"label":"Element","start_offset":490,"end_offset":497},{"id":15340,"label":"Element","start_offset":742,"end_offset":751},{"id":15341,"label":"Element","start_offset":840,"end_offset":847},{"id":15342,"label":"pH","start_offset":862,"end_offset":886},{"id":15343,"label":"pH","start_offset":983,"end_offset":998},{"id":15344,"label":"Element","start_offset":1618,"end_offset":1625},{"id":15345,"label":"Element","start_offset":1792,"end_offset":1799}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1664,"text":"The inevitable result of this phenomenon is poor adhesion of subsequent deposits. To minimize this effect, it is essential to employ a silver strike coating prior to the main deposit.21,24 In this work experiments were carried out on adhesion with and without strike coating. It was concluded that if the plating were carried out very rapidly, a good adhesion would be obtained in all electroplated targets without the need for strike coating. Embrittlement of metals has been recognized for many years but, as two authors have pointed out, some other defects in electrodeposits, such as blistering, cracking, gas pits, peeling off and poor adhesion, may also be related to hydrogen in ways not yet identified.26 Plating on a dietary or greasy surface inevitably leads to blistering or peeling of deposit. Cathodic cleaning in either acid or alkaline solutions provides large quantities of hydrogen for absorption.26 In all experiments, the substrate surface was cleaned with sandpaper of 1000 grade and immersed in the nitric acid bath of 0.3M. Then the surface was washed by water and its oil contaminators were removed by a mixture of the alkali cleaning powders. Finally, the surface was washed with acetone.   Table 4.

The evaluation of quality of the layers was achieved by comparison of the photomicrographs in terms of size and form of the Ag nuclei and the extent to which they overlapped each other.

The thermal shock tests involved the heating of the target up to 500 °C for 1 hour followed by submersion of the hot target in cold (8 °C) water. Observation of neither crack formation nor peeling off of the silver layers indicated a good adhesion for the purpose.

The radiation should be easy detectable; the half-life of the radioisotope should be neither too short nor too long; and the cost of the radioisotope should be moder- ate [1]. Lead-203 has a very simple decay mode (Fig. 1). It decays by electron capture followed by emission of γ-rays with energies of 279 (81%), 401 (5%), and 680 keV (0.9%). 203Pb with a half-life of 52 h is poten- tially useful for clinical scanning. High specific activ- ity and radiochemical purity of 203Pb are important for radiolabeling. 1–5 mCi of 203Pb radioisotope contains a trace amount of lead, which is less than 0.1% of the normal daily lead intake [2]. There are a number of methods for the 203Pb production [2–5]. Lead-203 is produced from either mercury or thal- lium target. Natural mercury has six stable isotopes. Several radionuclides of lead and thallium can be pro- duced by bombardment of natural mercury with 3He or 4He particles. Separation of 203Pb using this method is very difficult. The use of enriched mercury as a target material could partially solve this problem, but the cost of the obtained 203Pb will be very high. Therefore, the preferred target material for the production of 203Pb is tion for selective separation of lead ions have been reported [6–14]. In this work, we considered produc- tion of 203Pb by proton bombardment of natural thal- lium and its purification by conventional ion exchange, ion- solvent extraction, and novel nanomagnetic imprinted polymer methods.","entities":[{"id":15425,"label":"Element","start_offset":95,"end_offset":101},{"id":15426,"label":"Resin","start_offset":133,"end_offset":169},{"id":15427,"label":"Element","start_offset":529,"end_offset":537},{"id":15428,"label":"Element","start_offset":696,"end_offset":702},{"id":15429,"label":"Element","start_offset":827,"end_offset":833},{"id":15430,"label":"Element","start_offset":877,"end_offset":883},{"id":15431,"label":"Element","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1034},{"id":15432,"label":"Element","start_offset":1052,"end_offset":1060},{"id":15433,"label":"Element","start_offset":1085,"end_offset":1093},{"id":15434,"label":"Element","start_offset":1096,"end_offset":1106},{"id":15435,"label":"Element","start_offset":1181,"end_offset":1186},{"id":15436,"label":"Element","start_offset":1190,"end_offset":1199},{"id":15437,"label":"Element","start_offset":1243,"end_offset":1251},{"id":15438,"label":"Element","start_offset":1256,"end_offset":1260},{"id":15439,"label":"Element","start_offset":1263,"end_offset":1267},{"id":15440,"label":"Element","start_offset":1292,"end_offset":1298},{"id":15441,"label":"Element","start_offset":1355,"end_offset":1363},{"id":15442,"label":"Element","start_offset":1449,"end_offset":1455},{"id":15443,"label":"Element","start_offset":1537,"end_offset":1543},{"id":15444,"label":"Element","start_offset":1579,"end_offset":1583},{"id":15445,"label":"Element","start_offset":1660,"end_offset":1666},{"id":15446,"label":"Element","start_offset":1699,"end_offset":1709},{"id":15795,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1746,"end_offset":1759},{"id":15796,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1760,"end_offset":1784},{"id":15797,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1789,"end_offset":1834},{"id":15798,"label":"Element","start_offset":1123,"end_offset":1130},{"id":15799,"label":"Element","start_offset":923,"end_offset":927}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

The setup is shown in Fig. 2. 203Pb was detected by 279.2 and 401.3 keV lines in the γ-ray spectra of the samples. Only the more intense 279.2 keV line was used for the quantitative evalua- tion. Target dissolution. To separate 203Pb, the target (after irradiation) should be dissolved in an appropriate solvent. The target was eluted with 1 M HNO3, and natTl and 203Pb were collected in a beaker. This solution was stored and tagged with A. The target was irradiated for 30 min with 28.5 MeV protons at a beam current of 150 μA. The back of the Fig. 2. Target holder, beam current, and cooling water system (inlet and outlet).  Beam line   with 25 ml of 30% HCl. The solution containing 203Pb was transferred onto the column. In the course of elu- tion, 203Pb is washed out from the column, and the other nuclides remain adsorbed. The collected solution was heated to remove HCl, and the residue was dis- solved in normal saline solution. Solvent extraction. Another part of B was dis- solved in 8 M HCl. Iron was extracted with diisopropyl ether (DIPE), the aqueous phase was heated to evapo- rate the HCl, and the residue was dissolved in normal saline (0.9% w\/v NaCl). Solid phase extraction with nanomagnetic ion- imprinted polymer. The magnetic nanoparticles were prepared according to [20].","entities":[{"id":15478,"label":"Element","start_offset":4,"end_offset":9},{"id":15479,"label":"Element","start_offset":14,"end_offset":19},{"id":15480,"label":"Element","start_offset":24,"end_offset":29},{"id":15481,"label":"Element","start_offset":45,"end_offset":50},{"id":15482,"label":"Element","start_offset":56,"end_offset":61},{"id":15483,"label":"Element","start_offset":125,"end_offset":130},{"id":15484,"label":"Element","start_offset":144,"end_offset":152},{"id":15485,"label":"Element","start_offset":166,"end_offset":171},{"id":15486,"label":"Element","start_offset":177,"end_offset":182},{"id":15487,"label":"Element","start_offset":183,"end_offset":188},{"id":15488,"label":"Element","start_offset":194,"end_offset":199},{"id":15489,"label":"Element","start_offset":200,"end_offset":205},{"id":15490,"label":"Element","start_offset":211,"end_offset":216},{"id":15491,"label":"Element","start_offset":217,"end_offset":222},{"id":15492,"label":"Element","start_offset":228,"end_offset":233},{"id":15493,"label":"Element","start_offset":234,"end_offset":239},{"id":15494,"label":"Element","start_offset":244,"end_offset":249},{"id":15495,"label":"Element","start_offset":250,"end_offset":255},{"id":15496,"label":"Element","start_offset":263,"end_offset":269},{"id":15497,"label":"Element","start_offset":256,"end_offset":259},{"id":15498,"label":"Element","start_offset":272,"end_offset":278},{"id":15499,"label":"Element","start_offset":296,"end_offset":301},{"id":15500,"label":"Element","start_offset":405,"end_offset":410},{"id":15501,"label":"Element","start_offset":433,"end_offset":438},{"id":15502,"label":"Element","start_offset":443,"end_offset":448},{"id":15503,"label":"Element","start_offset":449,"end_offset":454},{"id":15504,"label":"Element","start_offset":460,"end_offset":465},{"id":15505,"label":"Element","start_offset":466,"end_offset":471},{"id":15506,"label":"Element","start_offset":477,"end_offset":482},{"id":15507,"label":"Element","start_offset":483,"end_offset":488},{"id":15508,"label":"Element","start_offset":494,"end_offset":499},{"id":15509,"label":"Element","start_offset":500,"end_offset":505},{"id":15510,"label":"Element","start_offset":511,"end_offset":516},{"id":15511,"label":"Element","start_offset":517,"end_offset":522},{"id":15512,"label":"Element","start_offset":528,"end_offset":533},{"id":15513,"label":"Element","start_offset":534,"end_offset":539},{"id":15514,"label":"Element","start_offset":545,"end_offset":550},{"id":15515,"label":"Element","start_offset":551,"end_offset":556},{"id":15516,"label":"Element","start_offset":562,"end_offset":567},{"id":15517,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":761,"end_offset":766},{"id":15518,"label":"Element","start_offset":798,"end_offset":803},{"id":15519,"label":"Method of Analysis","start_offset":852,"end_offset":866},{"id":15520,"label":"Element","start_offset":996,"end_offset":1001},{"id":15521,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":1108,"end_offset":1116},{"id":15522,"label":"Element","start_offset":1122,"end_offset":1127},{"id":15523,"label":"Element","start_offset":1132,"end_offset":1137},{"id":15524,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":1414,"end_offset":1430},{"id":15525,"label":"Element","start_offset":1456,"end_offset":1461},{"id":15526,"label":"Element","start_offset":1523,"end_offset":1528},{"id":15527,"label":"Acid","start_offset":1644,"end_offset":1647},{"id":15528,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":1691,"end_offset":1697},{"id":15529,"label":"Acid Concentration","start_offset":1765,"end_offset":1772},{"id":15530,"label":"Element","start_offset":1774,"end_offset":1778},{"id":15531,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1798,"end_offset":1815},{"id":15532,"label":"Separation Method","start_offset":1817,"end_offset":1821},{"id":15533,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":1917,"end_offset":1923},{"id":15534,"label":"Inorganic Solvent","start_offset":1925,"end_offset":1938}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1671,"text":"Briefly, to 20 mL of a 2 M FeCl3 solution in an Erlenmeyer flask, 13.3 mL of 1 M sodium sulfite was added dropwise under sonication over the course of 1 min. This solution was transferred to 250 mL of 0.85 M aqueous ammonia with vigorous stirring. The solution color turned from orange to black immediately. Then, 500 mL of deionized water was added to the mixture, and the mixture was heated at 90°C for 2 h with stirring in an air flow. To prepare Pb-imprinted amino-functionalized sor- bent based on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), 1.5 g of Pb(NO3)2 was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol with stir- ring and heating, and 5 mL of 3-aminopropyltri- ethoxysilane (APS) was added to the mixture. The so- lution was stirred and refluxed for 2 h. After that, 10 mL of glycerol and 30 mL of deionized water were added. Then, a portion of the suspension of MNPs in water was added. After stirring for 24 h and at 90°C, the sorbent was collected with a power magnet. Amino-functionalized MNPs were washed four times, each time with 25 mL of ethanol and 25 mL of 0.02 M NaCl. Finally, the particles were dried under in a vac- uum at 70–80°C for 12 h.  The γ-ray spectrum of the dissolved target is shown in Fig. 3. Radioisotopes of Tl and Pb are manifested in the spectrum. The γ-ray spectrum of the 203Pb solution is shown in Fig. 4. The 279.2 keV peak (fundamental γ-photon energy of 203Pb) is in the middle of the opti- mum range for detection with high efficiency. Samples for analysis of radionuclidic impurities were taken with a coring needle and analyzed by γ-ray spectros- copy. The radionuclidic purity of 203Pb exceeded 99.5%.    203Pb (279 keV)  Fig. 3. γ-Ray spectrum of the dissolved target (EOB, before separation).  After at least 37 h to ensure the decay of most of 201Pb (T1\/2 = 9.33 h) to 201Tl, about 5 mg of FeCl3 was added to a part of the nitrate solution (solution A) for precipitating 203Pb.

The separation yield was evaluated by dividing the amount of 203Pb after the separation by that before the separation. The yields of the ion ex- change and solvent extraction methods were 98.2 and 99.3%, respectively. No detectable radioactive impuri- ties were observed in the γ-ray spectrum. The characteristics of MNPs and magnetic ion- imprinted polymers (MIIPs) and the effect exerted by the type, concentration, volume, and pH were con- sidered. The lead ions were removed from MIIPs with 1 M HNO3, and the solution containing 203Pb (solution A) was loaded onto the sorbent at pH 6. Lead-203 was eluted from the sorbent with quantita- tive recovery (96.3%) in 2.5 mL of the eluent. Thus, the suggested method ensures high sensitivity of Pb determination. Thus, the cyclotron production of 203Pb from thal- lium provides a convenient source of this isotope for both tracer applications and SPECT imaging. The 203Tl(p,n)203Pb reaction is an efficient route to this iso- tope. The loss of 203Pb is less than 2% in both solvent extraction and ion exchange methods.
